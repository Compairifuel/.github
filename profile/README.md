# Compairifuel

**Compairifuel** is a mobile application designed to help users plan cheaper and more efficient routes to their destinations
by providing real-time fuel price comparisons and offering the option to select fuel stations along the way. With rising
fuel prices and growing awareness of sustainability, the app is aimed at individuals who want to save on fuel costs and
plan their travel more effectively. The app targets both men and women aged 18-70, with a low to average income, who
drive frequently.

## Project Timeline

**Start Date**: 16 August 2023<br>
**End Date**: Estimated at December 2023

Development Phases:
1. Ideation Phase<br>
2. Initiative Phase<br>
3. Definition Phase<br>
4. Design Phase<br>
5. Preparation Phase<br>
6. Realization Phase<br>
7. Maintenance Phase (Post-launch)

## Goals

The primary objective of this project is to develop an application that is:

**Cross-Platform**: Compatible with both Apple and Samsung devices.<br>
**User-Friendly**: Ergonomically designed to ensure ease of use.<br>
**Cost-Efficient**: Helps users save money on fuel through intelligent route planning and price comparison.

## Project Boundaries

**App Compatibility**: The app will be compatible with iOS 17.0.3+ and Android 12+ devices.<br>
**Geographical Scope**: Location-based services will be limited to the Netherlands.<br>
**Core Features**: Route planning, fuel price comparison, station details, and user guide.

## Deliverables

Upon completion, the following deliverables will be provided to Compairifuel:

A fully functional cross-platform app for both Apple and Samsung devices.<br>
An ergonomic and user-friendly design.<br>
A comprehensive user guide integrated into the app for ease of use.<br>
An app that effectively helps users reduce fuel costs through better route planning and station selection.

## Development Methodology

The app development will follow an Agile methodology, with sprints being applied during the design and realization
phases. Regular sprint reviews and sprint planning sessions will be held to monitor progress and adjust development
priorities.

## Project Team

**Project Leader**: Jaron Zijlstra<br>
**Client**: Jelle Schaafsma<br>
**Testers**: A dedicated group of testers will be responsible for testing the app's functionality across different devices
and platforms.

### Communication and Collaboration

The project will use GitHub for version control, project tracking, and collaboration. All key communication regarding
project updates, issues, and tasks will be documented and shared through this platform.

## Risk Management

Possible risks include:

**Delayed Development**: Due to team membersâ€™ academic commitments, a fixed daily work schedule is in place to ensure
consistent progress.<br>
**Data Accuracy**: Ensuring the accuracy of fuel price and location data is critical to the app's functionality.
